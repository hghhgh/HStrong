# HStrong
This project is a simple 2d game for android os. The game is about throwing a stone and should conduct it to goes as more as you can. Some obstackels (birds) are on the way of the stone. In this game we use 2d physic engine to handle collision between stone and birds. The throwing of the stone is done by accelerometer sensor of the phone that means you should shake the phone like throwing a stone (donet realy throw your phone !) to throw the stone in the game.

## Engine
We use [libGDX](https://libgdx.badlogicgames.com/index.html) game engine.
